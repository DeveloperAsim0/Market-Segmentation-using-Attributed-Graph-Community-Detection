# Market-Segmentation-using-Attributed-Graph-Community-Detection
Detection of vibrant communities within a social network

The project implements a research paper as listed in the repository to detect similar communities in a user's network. 

We use Python igraph object to build the graph object. We use Structure-Attribute Clustering Algorithms to detect the communities within a network and use Euclidean distance as a similarity metric as described in the paper.

We have used the social network data from Facebook.
